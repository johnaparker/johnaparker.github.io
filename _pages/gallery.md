    description: Electromagnetic field contours around three metal nanoparticles
    extra: "2D contours are shown in a plane parallel to the nanoparticles. A 3D contour shows the shape of the high intensity field just outside the surfaces of the nanoparticles. Image created with Paraview."

    description: Flow of electromagntic energy around a nanoscale optical matter machine
    extra: "Streamlines of the Poynting vector are shown around a hexagonal nanoparticle array composed of seven metal nanoparticles. The incident light is circularly polarized, generating a flow of electromagntic energy around the array that can be utilized to create a nanoscale machine. Reproduced from the paper [Optical matter machines: angular momentum conversion by collective modes in optically bound nanoparticle arrays](https://doi.org/10.1364/OPTICA.396147)."
